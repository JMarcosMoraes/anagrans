# Anagrans

# Primeira parte
Gerador de anagrans

### 1. Write a Java program to solve the following problem:
   You are tasked with creating a utility function for a text-processing application. The
   function must generate all possible anagrams from a given group of distinct letters. For
   example, the input {a, b, c} should return the output: abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba.
   Additional Requirements:
### 1. The program should accept any group of distinct letters as input and produce the
   correct result.
### 2. Optimize for readability and clarity.
### 3. Include basic validation (e.g., ensure the input is non-empty and contains only 
   letters).
### 4. Write unit tests to validate your function with at least three different test cases,
   including edge cases (e.g., input with a single letter or empty input).
### 5. Document your code clearly, explaining the logic for generating anagrams.

# Segunda parte

### 1. Provide an example scenario where overriding the equals() method is necessary in Java.
 Explain the key considerations when implementing this method, such as ensuring it
 aligns with the hashCode() method. Include code examples if possible.

### 2. Explain how you would use a design pattern to decouple your code from a third-party
 library that might be replaced in the future. Describe the advantages and limitations of
 your chosen approach, and provide a small code snippet illustrating its application.

### 3. Describe your experience with Angular, including its core features and use cases. Provide
 an example of a practical application where you used Angular and include a code snippet
 demonstrating a key feature, such as component communication, data binding, or
 service integration.

### 4. Discuss the techniques you use to prevent SQL injection attacks in web applications.
 Provide examples of code showing secure implementations, such as using parameterized
 queries or ORMs. Mention any additional measures you take to secure the database
 layer.

### 5. Describe the steps you would take to diagnose and improve the performance of a batch
 process that interacts with a database and an FTP server. Explain how you would identify
 bottlenecks, optimize database queries, improve logic execution, and enhance file
 transfer efficiency. Provide examples of tools or techniques you would use during the
 analysis.
